  <!-- Requirements
Visualization
    User can click on an image to generate a resource
    Users have an up-to-date count of their resources
    Users have at least 4 upgrades to purchase
    Users can see how many of each resource they have and the amount of modification that resource provides
Functionality
    At least 1 click upgrade and 1 automatic upgrade
    Automatic upgrades are applied at least every 3 seconds, and the screen is updated to reflect this change
    Users cannot purchase an upgrade if they do not have the resources
    Upgrades have different modifier values
    When a user buys an upgrade, the price of the upgrade goes up
Stretch Goal Ideas
    Instead of a basic count, use images or icons to represent how many of a purchasable the user has
    Prevent the user from writing a loop to click by setting a 'cooldown' between clicks
    Disable the buttons a user cannot purchase and enable them if they have enough money
    Unlock/hide upgrades until the user has enough resources at least once to afford the item
    Consider how you could add bonuses that could increase the multiplier of automaticUpgrades
    Try using localstorage to save your game progress between page reloads
    TODO Create a badge system to mark user milestones ex. award "The Collector" for mining 1,000,000 total Cheese
    Create a way to decrease the interval of automaticCollection
    Pre vent the collectionInterval from being started more than once -->
